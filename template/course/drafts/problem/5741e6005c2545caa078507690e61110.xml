  Your box of cereal may be a contest winner! It's rattling, which 100% of winning boxes do. Of course 1% of all boxes rattle and only one box in a million is a winner. What is the probability that your box is a winner? Please specify your answer as a probability (i.e. .05 rather than 5%).

  <solution>
Recall Bayes' rule, which states that \(P(A\vert B) = \frac{P(B\vert A) * P(A)}{P(B)}\).<br/><br/>
The question asks to find \(P(winner|rattling)\) given that \(P(rattling) = .01\), \(P(winner) = .000001\), and \(P(rattling \vert winner) = 1\). <br/>
Plugging these values into Bayes' rule gives \(\frac{1*.000001}{.01}=.0001\)<br/><br/>
More explicitly, if you haven't seen Bayes' rule before: <br/>
\(P(winner \vert rattling) = \frac{P(winner, rattling)}{P(rattling)}\)<br/>
\(P(winner, rattling) = P(rattling \vert winner) * P(winner)\)<br/>
\(P(winner \vert rattling) = \frac{P(rattling \vert winner) * P(winner)}{P(rattling)} = \frac{1*.000001}{.01}=.0001\)
</solution>
