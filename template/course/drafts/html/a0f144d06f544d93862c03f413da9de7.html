<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">
<li>6 projects (numbered 0-5). We allow students to submit up to two days late (read the Grading section below for more details), so we have also included 1-day and 2-day late identical copies of the projects</li>
<li>10 homework assignments (numbered 1-10)</li>
<li>11 sets of lecture videos (for the first half-semester of Berkeley&rsquo;s local course)</li>
<li>23 sets of lecture videos (unedited videos from the Fall 2013 offering of the course, which can be found in the last section in the "Courseware" section under the tab "Fall 2013 Live Lecture Videos")</li>
<li>23 sets of lecture videos (unedited videos from the Spring 2014 offering of the course, which can be found in the last section in the "Courseware" section under the tab "Fall 2013 Live Lecture Videos")</li>
<li>3 practice midterms (for the first half-semester of Berkeley&rsquo;s local course; these were the midterms used in the 188.1x open online (MOOC) offering)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Practice&rdquo; versions of the projects and assignments (for additional practice or make-ups; we release these AFTER the main deadlines pass to avoid confusion)</li>
<li>Links to exams from previous CS188 offerings, under the "Exams" section</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 15pt; margin-bottom: 16pt;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #4c4c4c; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">You are of course free to structure your course policies as you prefer; this section is to give context to how these materials are used in the Berkeley local offering.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 15pt; margin-bottom: 16pt;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #4c4c4c; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The Berkeley offering: We have lectures of approximately 350 students (mostly juniors) per semester. &nbsp;Students have two 90-minute lectures a week, as well as a more free-form one-hour discussion section, 30 students per section. &nbsp;Our local course runs for 13 weeks and the online offering covers the first half (projects and assignments for the entire course are included here). &nbsp;Videos cover only the online half and are edits from live lectures from Fall 2012.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 15pt; margin-bottom: 16pt;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #4c4c4c; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Student work: For projects, we allow students to work in groups of two (or solo). &nbsp;For assignments, we allow students to discuss in groups of arbitrary size but require them to submit their own solutions. &nbsp;In general, we encourage students to help students, including answering posts in spoiler-free ways on the class forums. &nbsp;Projects and assignments can be submitted as many times as students desire (and for projects they may run their local autograders as often as they like). &nbsp;The intent is that projects and assignments are instruction, not assessment, and we encourage students to continue working until mastery. &nbsp;Our assessment is primarily through exams. &nbsp;A small number of points are allocated as extra credit and are much more difficult.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 15pt; margin-bottom: 16pt;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #4c4c4c; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Grading: All projects and assignments are fully autograded. &nbsp;Deadlines are softened in two ways. &nbsp;First, we allow students to drop the lowest assignment (you can configure whether you want to allow this option). &nbsp;Second, we give students a fixed budget of late days (usually 5 per semester), which they can use whenever they like. &nbsp;The late day option is not yet implemented on the edX platform, so we track this manually. &nbsp;The reasoning is that allowing late assignments is not useful (we cover them immediately in section) while skipping a project due to, e.g. illness, needs to be avoided.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 15pt; margin-bottom: 16pt;"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Arial; color: #4c4c4c; background-color: #ffffff; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Prerequisites: We assume students have seen the basics of discrete probability, though we recap this material from scratch. &nbsp;We assume students can understand and produce significant code in Python, though we include a quick tutorial / refresher. &nbsp;Locally, we require our discrete math and data structures courses, but in practice students often skip one or the other and are generally fine if they have sufficiently strong general math and CS experience.</span></p>
