<section><article><h2>November 13, 2014</h2><p>Welcome to the archived materials from the Fall 2013 CS188 Artificial Intelligence on-campus offering at UC Berkeley. These materials are made available for anyone for self-study, but there will be no active support from the teaching staff for these materials. We do hope to offer this course with active support again in the future. Instructors in particular might also want to check out <a href="http://ai.berkeley.edu">ai.berkeley.edu</a>, where we host all of our materials for instructors.</p></article></section>
