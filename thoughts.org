#+STARTUP: logdone

* Ideas/thoughts
** Surveys
*** Edx survey/poll tool
**** con: Doesn't look very good.
**** con: Style is weird (json embedded into xml??).
**** con: Only has aggregated results?
*** Edx ungraded (quiz) questions
**** q: When can we get exports from this?
**** q: Option for "do not show answers" not available in ruql. Add this
    functionality and make a pull request?
*** External tool like Qualtrics
**** pro: +Possibly+ has integration into edX.
**** pro: Does have a data format and is included in ruql!!!!
**** q: Might need to pay. (don't think so because Berkeley account)
**** pro: data export available at all times
**** instructions: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZkZ-EWyQy1q9CF6tOXNllcbddXGcRElcG7lLxnTMRU/edit#heading=h.9itf2oatckgb

*** Notes on survey design article (https://zapier.com/learn/ultimate-guide-to-forms-and-surveys/design-analyze-survey/)
**** "It's better to send out a few rounds of improving surveys than a huge blast that misses the mark" 
*** Notes on MOOC data collection articles (http://www.edtechresearcher.com/blog-archive/)
**** Article 1: Student Diversity
***** Participants (especially those who complete the course) tend to be relatively affluent
***** Community support structures can help improve participation/success
**** Article 2: Flexibility and Stickiness
***** Students get *more* behind if course is released in phases (as opposed to all at once).
      However, they greatly benefit from frequent (i.e. weekly/daily) engagement.
      How can we encourage this? Piazza? Reminder emails?
***** Students who do more smaller, spaced out study sessions tend to do better
**** Article 3: Persistence and Activity
***** Overall completion rates are poor. However, things look better after
      controlling for student intentions. Not all students intend to receive a certificate.
      *This is something we should survey!*
***** Once students start the course, predicting continuation week to week
      and completion is fairly easy (people have built successful
      models). "The more interesting question is
      whether course teams can partner with researchers to create
      interventions that actually change a studentâ€™s predicted
      trajectory for the better. At present, for all of our skill at
      prediction, within MOOCs we have yet to develop instructional
      approaches for supporting students that take advantage of those
      predictions to improve student learning."
**** Article 4: Helping Busy Students Stick to Plans
***** Surveys are great, but even if we force enrolled students to take them,
      that doesn't help us with dropouts.
***** Surveying dropouts can help us proactively help people stay in the course
      What can we do for them?
***** Models exist for guessing if someone is a dropout. Can we send targeted
      surveys to these people and find out why they left?
* Todo List
** DONE Read survey design article
** TODO Read MOOC data articles 1-4
** TODO Check back for 5-7, probably around July 20, 24, 28
** DONE Email Will and Peitian about BJCx stuff
   CLOSED: [2015-07-17 Fri 12:45]
** TODO Attempt to set up a qualtrics survey and integrate into edX. See
