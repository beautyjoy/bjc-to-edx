<p>The Max block</p>
<!--ORIGINAL NAME: The Max Block-->
<p>We are going to look more closely at the custom <tt>max</tt> block. Recall, <img class="inline" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/blocks/max.png" /> takes two numbers as input and reports the bigger value (the maximum).</p>
<p><img class="center" alt="max block being executed" src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/prog/max-block-executed-BYOB.jpg" /></p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg shows you his version of <tt>max</tt> that doesn't seem to be working correctly:</p>
<div class="indent"><a class="run" href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#open:http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/prog/building-blocks/max-buggy.xml"> <img src="http://bjc.berkeley.edu/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-code-buggy.png" alt="Buggy max code" /> </a></div>

<li>Try to predict what this <tt>max</tt> block reports for various input values. If you need extra help click on the picture above to go to a <span class="snap">snap</span> file containing the code.</li>

<p><br />2. With a fellow student, describe how to fix the faulty <tt>max</tt> block. What confusion did Mr. Zuckerberg seem to have?</p>
