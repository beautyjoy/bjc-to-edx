<p><span size="-1" style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; line-height: normal;">(an elementary proof of the undecidability of the halting problem)</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"></span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">No program can say what another will do.&nbsp;<br />Now, I won't just assert that, I'll prove it to you:<br />I will prove that although you might work til you drop,<br />you can't predict whether a program will stop.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Imagine we have a procedure called P<br />that will snoop in the source code of programs to see<br />there aren't infinite loops that go round and around;<br />and P prints the word "Fine!" if no looping is found.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">You feed in your code, and the input it needs,<br />and then P takes them both and it studies and reads<br />and computes whether things will all end as the should<br />(as opposed to going loopy the way that they could).</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Well, the truth is that P cannot possibly be,<br />because if you wrote it and gave it to me,<br />I could use it to set up a logical bind<br />that would shatter your reason and scramble your mind.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Here's the trick I would use - and it's simple to do.<br />I'd define a procedure - we'll name the thing Q -<br />that would take and program and call P (of course!)<br />to tell if it looped, by reading the source;</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">And if so, Q would simply print "Loop!" and then stop;<br />but if no, Q would go right back to the top,&nbsp;<br />and start off again, looping endlessly back,<br />til the universe dies and is frozen and black.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">And this program called Q wouldn't stay on the shelf;<br />I would run it, and (fiendishly) feed it&nbsp;<i>itself</i>.<br />What behaviour results when I do this with Q?<br />When it reads its own source, just what will it do?</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">If P warns of loops, Q will print "Loop!" and quit;<br />yet P is supposed to speak truly of it.<br />So if Q's going to quit, then P should say, "Fine!" -<br />which will make Q go back to its very first line!</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">No matter what P would have done, Q will scoop it:<br />Q uses P's output to make P look stupid.<br />If P gets things right then it lies in its tooth;<br />and if it speaks falsely, it's telling the truth!</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">I've created a paradox, neat as can be -<br />and simply by using your putative P.<br />When you assumed P you stepped into a snare;<br />Your assumptions have led you right into my lair.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">So, how to escape from this logical mess?<br />I don't have to tell you; I'm sure you can guess.<br />By&nbsp;<i>reductio</i>, there cannot possibly be<br />a procedure that acts like the mythical P.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">You can never discover mechanical means<br />for predicting the acts of computing machines.<br />It's something that cannot be done. So we users<br />must find our own bugs; our computers are losers!</p>
