WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR ACADEMIC PATH?
I grew up in Fair Oaks, a small suburb just outside of Sacramento, about an hour and a half north of Berkeley.  I had a great experience going to Bella Vista High School (Go Broncos!) participating in Student Government, Academic Decathlon, and Cross Country/Track and Field.  When I first entered UC Berkeley, I wanted to get my degree in Economics.  However, after taking CS10, I hope to get my Computer Science degree, along with a minor in Music.  

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?
Coming into Cal, I had never programmed before! So I can completely sympathize with people that are coming into this class with little to no knowledge about programming.   However, now that I have taken CS61A and CS61B (the "next two" classes you will take if you want to become a CS major or minor), I have a good grasp of Python, Scheme, and Java.  I am also in the process of learning Apple's new language, Swift, which was just announced this year, in order to create some Apps for the App Store.  I am also very familiar with Windows, OS X, Unix, and most other major OS.  

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I am a huge music junkie.  Hit me up if you have any music recommendations, especially if they are Alt or indie rock.  I also play piano, love to run long distance, and play some video games (MOBA, shooters, RPG, pretty much anything). 


WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?
Running I guess could apply here. My PR's are not all that great to those that run on a daily basis, but I do enjoy the sport. 1600: 4:51 3200: 10:19.  Half Marathon: 1:41.  I am hoping to get in some more road races while I am at Berkeley.  I have played piano for the last 10 years of my life, and I consider myself a pretty big music aficionado.  Test my knowledge!


HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE?
I have won a Gold Medal at the State level competition for Academic Decathlon in the Speech category, specifically talking about my dad and the sport of running.  That will always be a really special moment for me, because it was such a personal speech, and it was great for it to be recognized.   

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?
Besides serving as a reader for CS10, I will be taking two additional classes (6 units in total). I will also be working another job as an Admin Assistant to the Dean's Office in the College of Environmental Design, so feel free to stop by and say hi!  I also serve as the treasurer of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity, so if you have any questions about the greek community at Cal, I have a decent wealth of knowledge.  Welcome to CS10! Go Bears!
