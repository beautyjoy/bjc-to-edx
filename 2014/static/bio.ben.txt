WHERE DID YOU GROW UP? WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
   I was born in San Leandro, CA (two cities south of Berkeley), and grew up in Tracy, CA. I attended a Millennium High School (a charter school) and also spent some time attending San Joaquin Delta College, too. I was accepted to UC Berkeley as a freshman spring admit and am now starting senior year. I'm a cognitive science major, and have many interests - including CS. 

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE (& WHAT LANGUAGES)?
   I've had a about a year and a half of programming experience starting with Scratch/BYOB (before Snap!) in CS10, Python/Scheme in CS61A, and Java in CS61B. I've also taken CS 70 and 195. If you're curious about any of these classes, feel free to ask me. 

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
   I'm a huge fan of professional wrestling (yeah, the 'fake' stuff) and even teach a DeCal about it in the department of Film & Media studies. Check it out if you'd like. I also like to read for fun when I have the time, and go to movies and hang out with friends. I also like sudoku puzzles!

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS & SKILLS?
   I've been a student intern at Sandia National Laboratories (in Livermore, CA) for the past four years. I've worked on algal and bacterial biofeuls research and development (R&D) in applied biology laboratories doing a bunch of wet lab work and data analysis. I've done work with cell culture, spectroscopy, genetics, and molecular cloning. 

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
   From my reseach at my internship, I've co-authored two articles: "Multiplex fluorometric assessment of nutrient limitation as a strategy for enhanced lipid enrichment and harvesting in Neochloris Oleoabundans" in the Journal of Biotechnology & Bioengineering, and "The role of photo-osmotic adaptation in semi-continuous culture and lipid particle release from Dunaliella viridis" in the Journal of Applied Phycology ("phycology" is the study of algae :-) ). Currently, I'm in the process of being a research assistant in the Cognitive Neuroscience Knight Research Laboratory. Also, through my DeCal course, I was able to take my class on a field trip to a live WWE show. Before the show, we got to go backstage, meet some wrestlers, and have a private Q&A session - which is something that regular fans would never get the opportunity to do!

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS SEMESTER?
   This summer, I'm planning to be a research assistant in the Cognitive Neuroscience Knight Research Laboratory. Despite already being a senior (yikes!), this will be my first summer spent in Berkeley, so I'm looking forward to seeing how campus is this time of year. The only class I'm taking this summer is CS375, which will help me be the best TA I can be to help you learn, which is my top priority!
