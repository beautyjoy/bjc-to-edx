WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grew up in Orinda, which is just one bart stop away from the Rockridge stop or about a fifteen minute drive from Berkeley. I went to Miramonte High School and came to Cal as a spring admit, so I also attended FPF my first semester.

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?
I've programmed for about a year and a half now. I've worked a lot with Scratch/BYOB/Snap! due to CS10 and then I've also learned Python and Scheme in CS61A and Java in CS61B. Way, way back in seventh grade I also learned HTML, but those skills have become very, very rusty.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I really like to write and read when I have the time, but, at least during semester, I usually spend my time taking naps, which is high on my 'hobbies' list. I also enjoy making paper cranes and singing along to musicals.

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?
I'd like to say I'm a fairly decent writer and I really like listening to people so if you have anything you want to talk about, feel free to catch me in lab or office hours.

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
I started writing in sixth grade and finished my first story, complete with chapters and plot and over a hundred pages, within that year and one of my friends at the time bound it into a legitimate-looking book, which is now in my closet and will probably never see the light of day again.

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?
This summer I'll be taking CS70, so that and CS10 will be consuming a lot of my time.
