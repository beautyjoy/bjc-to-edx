WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR ACADEMIC PATH?
I grew up in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, far far away from Cal. I came here looking to study business at the Haas school. I took CS 10 just for fun and now I'm in a bit of a limbo. Haas or CS? Both? I actually haven't decided. I'll keep you updated.

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?
My first programming language was Snap which I learnt while taking CS 10 in Fall 2013. I went on to learn python and scheme through CS 61A. I will be learning java over summer 2014. Yup, I'm not one of those guys who's been coding since he was 2 years old.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES? WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?
I love golf. I love cricket. I love watching sport. I strongly believe that Virat Kohli is the greatest cricketer to have graced the game. I also love good clothes and shoes so I like going to the malls with my mom. A golf game with dad is priority over anything else in the world though. I can sleep for durations in excess of 12 hours.

HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE?
Not really. Geez, I'm only 19, give me some time. Let's talk in a few years time.

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?
Reading for CS 10 (captain obvious in the house, ladies and gentlemen). CS 61BL - essentially 61B with a twist. I also want attend some CS 70 lectures.
