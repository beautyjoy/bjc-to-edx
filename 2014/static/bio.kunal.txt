WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR PATH TO CAL?
I grew up in Elk Grove, a small town outside of Sacramento. I went to Pleasant Grove High School and came to Cal in 2012.

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?
I've programmed for about two years now. I have worked mainly with Python, JavaScript, C, and Java. I first learned with CS10 in Summer 2012 - that was a great decision.

WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I like to play music, learn about anything, chat about life, and laugh. Friends, song, food, and crazy ideas.

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?
I like...cheese. Yeah. I'm good at that.

HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE? HAS ANYTHING MEMORABLE HAPPENED TO YOU?
I play the Campanile! About sixteen students take lessons, facilitate the DeCal, and play on the loudest instrument in town.

WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?
During the day, I'll be working at a startup in San Francisco (Kamcord.com). I won't hold regular discussion for CS10 but I will be managing the edX platform. Feel free to message me about anything at marwahaha@berkeley.edu :-)
