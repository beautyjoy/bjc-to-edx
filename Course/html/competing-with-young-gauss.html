 <h1>Competing with Young Gauss</h1>         <p>
             We would like to add all the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code>, where <code>N</code> could
             be a big number.  The obvious way to do this is to 
             simply add them up, one by one.
         </p>

             We can, however, also follow in the footsteps of the young Johann Carl
             Friedrich Gauss, a now-revered 18th century mathematician. As the
             story goes, he was punished by his elementary
             school teacher to do the same exercise: add all the 
             numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>100</code>. 
             The teacher, J. G. Büttner, assumed that the problem
             would take Gauss a long time to do, yet Gauss finished 
             the problem in a matter of seconds. He realized that,
             adding <code>1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100</code> was the same as 
             adding <code>(1 + 100) + (2 + 99) + (3 + 98) + ... + (50 + 51)</code>.
             Each pair summed up to <code>101</code>, and there were 
             <code>50</code> of these pairs, so he quickly deduced that the 
             answer was &nbsp;<code>101 &times; 50 = 5050</code>.
             Presumably, teacher Büttner wasn't pleased.
         </p>
         <p class="alert quoteOrange">
             In general, if you wanted to add the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code>, the answer would be 
             <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>(N + 1) &times; (N &divide; 2)</code>,
             <br>
             because there are <code>(N &divide; 2)</code> pairs, each of which add up to <code>(N + 1)</code>.
         </p>
         <p>
             Imagine that you are playing a game against young Gauss to see who could add numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>N</code> faster:
             he does it his way, while you manually add them one by one. You can either win, lose, or tie in this game.
             What do you think would happen if <code>N</code> is <code>2</code>? If <code>N</code> is <code>10</code>?
             If <code>N</code> is <code>100</code>? If <code>N</code> is one million?
