In addition to you and your classmates' submissions in the discussion forum, <a target="_blank" href="http://cybernetnews.com/cybernotes-life-before-the-internet-was-like/"><span class="nolink">CyberNetNews</span></a> mentions a number of differences between then (15 years ago) and now.<br><br>The Internet today provides a tremendous service of making information available to anyone in the world that can connect to it. "Information" can take the form of company websites, email, instant messaging, audio / video, and many, many other possibilities.<br><h2>Early Search Engines</h2>The time of the Internet before search engines was tough as well. The Internet was the same decentralized, wildly diverse collection of information that it is today (although a good bit smaller), but was also terribly difficult to navigate: it was comparable to a telephone network without a phone book. Finding your way to new places on the Internet often involved someone telling you about their site, or stumbling across a site from one you were already familiar with.<br>Not being ones to shy from problems, computer scientists noticed this shortcoming and began working on technology that would automatically <span style="font-style: italic;">crawl</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">index </span>(more on these later in <a href="http://veritas.eecs.berkeley.edu/courses/mod/resource/view.php?id=1890">How
