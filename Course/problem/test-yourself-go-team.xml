                    What does the following set of scripts do when the <code>Turn1</code> message is broadcast?

                        Right!
                        Here, we see an <em>infinite loop,</em> or a never-ending loop. 
                        Whenever this happens in Snap<em>!</em>, we can always stop it by 
                        pressing the Stop button at the top right of the window, just above the stage.
                    </p>
<p>
                        Why does this happen? Well, when you the <code>Turn1</code> message is first broadcast,
                        the sprite says <code> Go!</code>
                        for half a second, and then broadcasts a <code>Turn2</code> message.
                    </p>
<p>
                        If there is any character that has a script that responds to the <code>Turn2</code>
                        message, it will perform that script. 
                        In this case, the same sprite has a script that responds to the <code>Turn2</code>
                        message, and so it will run the corresponding script. It says <code>Team!</code>
                        and then broadcasts a <code>Turn1</code>
                        message. But, it also has a script that responds to the <code>Turn1</code>
                        message, which in turn sends a <code>Turn2</code>
                        message, and so on. This continues until the scripts are forced to stop.
