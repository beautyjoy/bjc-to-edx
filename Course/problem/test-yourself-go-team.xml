<problem><p><p>
                    Without trying this in Snap, try to answer the following question:
                    <br/>
<br/>
                    What does the following set of scripts do when the <code>Turn1</code> message is broadcast?
                </p>


<p><img alt="receive turn1 broadcast script" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/receive-turn1-broadcast.png"/>     
                    <img alt="receive turn2 broadcast script" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/receive-turn2-broadcast.png"/>
</p>

broadcast Turn1 and wait
block after the
say Team! ...
block will execute.
Snap
will blindly follow its script.</choicehint></choice><choice correct="true">The sprite repeatedly says "Go!" and then "Team!" until you hit the red Stop button.<choicehint>Right!
                        Here, we see an
infinite loop,
or a never-ending loop. 
                        Whenever this happens in Snap
!
, we can always stop it by 
                        pressing the Stop button at the top right of the window, just above the stage.
Why does this happen? Well, when you the
Turn1
message is first broadcast,
                        the sprite says
Go!
for half a second, and then broadcasts a
Turn2
message.
If there is any character that has a script that responds to the
Turn2
message, it will perform that script. 
                        In this case, the same sprite has a script that responds to the
Turn2
message, and so it will run the corresponding script. It says
Team!
and then broadcasts a
Turn1
message. But, it also has a script that responds to the
Turn1
message, which in turn sends a
Turn2
message, and so on. This continues until the scripts are forced to stop.</choicehint></choice><choice correct="false">Nothing happens - the script does not work.<choicehint>No, the script here definitely does something when receiving the
Turn1
script.</choicehint></choice><choice correct="false">The sprite says "Go!" and then "Team!", repeating a few times, and then stops by itself.<choicehint>No.  The computer can't just decide to stop itself; rather, it will blindly follow the script.</choicehint></choice></choicegroup></multiplechoiceresponse><solution><div class="detailed-solution"><p>Explanation</p><p><p>

                        Why does this happen? Well, when you the <code>Turn1</code> message is first broadcast,
                        the sprite says <code> Go!</code>
                        for half a second, and then broadcasts a <code>Turn2</code> message.
