  Without trying this in
  &lt;span class="snap"&gt;
   snap
  &lt;/span&gt;
  , try to answer the following question:
  &lt;br/&gt;
  &lt;br/&gt;
  What does the following set of scripts do when the
  &lt;code&gt;
   Turn1
  &lt;/code&gt;
  message is broadcast?
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img alt="receive turn1 broadcast script" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/receive-turn1-broadcast.png"/&gt;
  &lt;img alt="receive turn2 broadcast script" src="/bjc-r/img/prog/receive-turn2-broadcast.png"/&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
  Choose one:
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Well, when you the Turn1 message is first broadcast,\n                        the sprite says  Go!\n                        for half a second, and then broadcasts a Turn2 message.\n                    \n\n                        If there is any character that has a script that responds to the Turn2\n                        message, it will perform that script. \n                        In this case, the same sprite has a script that responds to the Turn2\n                        message, and so it will run the corresponding script. It says Team!\n                        and then broadcasts a Turn1\n                        message. But, it also has a script that responds to the Turn1\n                        message, which in turn sends a Turn2\n                        message, and so on. This continues until the scripts are forced to stop.'</p></div></solution></problem>
